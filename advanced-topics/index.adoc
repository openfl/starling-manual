= Advanced Topics

With all the things we learned in the previous chapters, you are already well equipped to start using Starling in real projects.
However, while doing so, you might run into a few things that might be puzzling.
For example,

* your textures are quickly consuming all available memory.
* you are encountering a _context loss_ from time to time. WTF!?footnote:[My editor said it's not polite to swear, but (1) I used an acronym and (2) context loss really s*cks.]
* you are actually a little disappointed by the performance of your application. You want more speed!
* or you might be one of those masochists who likes to write their own vertex and fragment shaders, but didn't know where to start.

Oddly enough, that perfectly summarizes what this chapter is about.
Buckle up Dorothy, we are now jumping into some advanced topics!
